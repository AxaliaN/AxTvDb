AxTvDb
====

This is a modification of Jérôme Poskin awesome TvDb module

What does it do:
----------------

It implements all the functionality of the original TvDb module, but I moved everything around a bit to conform to the Zend 2 module standard.

I plan to improve the logic more, to remove functionality from Client which, in my opinion, should be in different classes.

Status:
-------
This version is in alpha :P
